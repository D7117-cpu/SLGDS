This repository has two folders: Codes and ErrataNotes. The folder Codes contains most of the R-codes used in the book. These codes are labelled using four digits. The first two refer to the chapter in the book, and the other two refer to the actual code as it appears in the book, in consecutive order. For example, code0103.R, is the third code in chapter 1. The labels of the codes in the folder Codes, coincide with the lables of the R-codes used in the book.  

  The folder ErrataNotes contains errata and notes. The errata are pdf files named after chapter (first two digits), and their consecutive order, according to the time of discovery (second two digits). For example, errata0302.pdf, is the second errata (in terms of noment of discovery) that belongs in chapter 3.
